You're wired up to let me go
It's temporary, is that what you want me to know
The black of my boot is going, going
Ray ray rays rays gamma rays

You've got to forget him
Or get him
You've got to forget him
Or get him

Was that the dress code
Come in your own clothes
Was that the dress code
Come in your own clothes

It's not a big deal I just want to laugh with you,
It's not a big deal I just want to walk with you,
I don't want to sleep with you!

I just, just, want to be with you, in a, bubble bath
As friends in the bubble bath.

At 57 she cooked a meal for the first time,
And in the bones she saw a sign,
A sign that would change her forever.
Her essence of life could be saved
By surfing a heatwave

Ray ray rays rays gamma rays
One one one, wanna, wanna, wanna

Was that the dress code
Come in your own clothes
Was that the dress code
Come in your own clothes

It's not a big deal I just want to laugh with you,
It's not a big deal I don't actually want to be with you,
I don't want to sleep with you!
I'm not here to be sexy

It's not a big deal just have a bubble bath with me,
As friends we'll be so happy

As friends in the bubble bath

It's not a big deal can't you see,
I just wanna be friends in the bubble bath
Just you and me nothing sexy

That's all I want to do
That's all I want to do
That's all I want to do

It's not a big deal I just want to laugh with you,
It's not a big deal I just want to walk with you,
I don't want to sleep with you!
I just, just want to be with you, in a...
Bubble bath
As friends in the bubble bath.
