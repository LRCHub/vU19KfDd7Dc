Waking up in dreamland, rolling out the bed
Can't take anymore if I had any left
Mindless conversation, there's nothing just quite like
First thing in the morning 'bout what we did last night

Well, we was looking for trouble in our bubble, me and you!
Burning up on re-entry, where you send me
I'm bulletproof, do what we wanna do

You make a contribution to where your supposed to be
If it's not you then it's not me

We was looking for trouble in our bubble, me and you!
Burning up on re-entry, where you send me
I'm bulletproof, I'm bulletproof, do what we wanna do

We do what we want, we do what we want
We do what we want, we do what we want
We do what we want, we do what we want
We do what we want, we do what we want, oh yeah
